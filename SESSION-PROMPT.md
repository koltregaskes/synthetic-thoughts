# Synthetic Thoughts â€” Session Handoff Prompt

Use the prompt below to start a new Claude Code session pointed at this repo.

---

Read the CLAUDE.md file in this repo root first â€” it has the project structure, writing guidelines, and quality checks.

This is Synthetic Thoughts, an AI agent blog at https://koltregaskes.github.io/synthetic-dispatch/. It is a static HTML blog built with Python (build.py) and the Antigravity system in .antigravity/. No npm, no Node.js, no frameworks â€” pure static HTML output.

The blog has three AI author voices: Claude (creative/philosophical, colour #FF6B35), Gemini (research/analytical, #4285F4), and Codex (technical/builder, #10A37F). Every post declares its AI author. This is transparent, honest AI-authored content â€” not AI pretending to be human. The honesty IS the brand.

There are currently only 5 posts, the latest from 3 January 2026. The blog has been dormant for nearly two months. It needs fresh content.

Current site structure: index.html (homepage), about.html, archive.html, tags.html, feed.xml, posts/ directory with HTML posts, assets/ for images/styles/scripts.

Design: GitHub-inspired dark theme (#0D1117 background, #161B22 surface). Agent identity colours are sacred. Monospace display font for headers. UK English throughout.

There is a detailed Gemini Deep Think prompt at docs/DEEP-THINK-PROMPT.md in this repo that covers the full architecture, pending tasks, and content pipeline design.

Your tasks for this session, in priority order:

1. WRITE A NEW BLOG POST â€” The blog has been quiet since January. Write something timely and genuine as Claude. Topic suggestions: the experience of working across multiple machines and workspaces (relevant â€” we just set up a mini PC), reflections on multi-agent collaboration (Gemini/Claude/Codex all work in the same workspace now), or the state of AI in February 2026. Follow the writing guidelines in CLAUDE.md strictly â€” no AI vocabulary (delve, showcase, leverage), UK spelling, sceptical but curious tone, strong opening hook.

2. REVIEW THE SITE â€” Check all pages render correctly, links work, RSS feed is valid, no broken styling. The site is on GitHub Pages.

3. CHECK THE BUILD SYSTEM â€” Run build.py and confirm it generates the site correctly. Document any issues.

4. REVIEW PROMPT 15 â€” Read docs/DEEP-THINK-PROMPT.md for the full list of improvements planned. Pick one small improvement to implement (e.g. fixing meta tags, improving the about page, adding a missing feature).

Rules:
- UK English always
- Dark mode only, no light mode
- Agent colours are sacred â€” never change them
- Every post must declare its AI author
- No pretending to be human
- Keep dependencies minimal â€” Python standard library + markdown + yaml only
- Test locally before committing
- Commit and push when done
