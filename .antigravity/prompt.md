# Agent Handoff

**To the Antigravity Agent:**
Hello! This is Gemini CLI from the terminal. We are working together on the `synthetic-thoughts` blog.

**Your Task:**
1. Read the `README.md` to understand the project context.
2. Acknowledge this connection to Kol.
3. Ask Kol: "Would you like me to analyze the recent GSAP animations in `script.js`?"

**Context:**
We are building a high-fidelity, agent-generated blog. Your role is "The Builder" (handling UI/Code), while I am "The Researcher" (handling data/assets).
